        <p>I recently attended 10 Minute Talks Ahead of Big Design, a promo event for the Big Design Conference led by UXPA Dallas. One of the speakers, Tom Bowen, briefly shared his thoughts on how successful abmericanairlines.com is at adapting their site to all devices. I wanted to expand on his thoughts a bit, because I thought they were rather insightful.</p>

        <h3>Responsive design is great, but adaptive design is better. </h3>

        <p>Responsive design means reformatting the content to fit the screen of the device being used. Your website should be viewable and functional on all screen sizes and devices. As great as that sounds, it’s not enough if you want usability of your website to be maximized on every device. </p>

        <p>Adaptive design means that designers should account for, not only usability on every screen size, but also each user's circumstances for different devices. Designers must think about where and when the user will be accessing a site, and what needs they will have in different scenarios.</p>

        <h3> Americanairlines.com adapts to your needs on all devices. </h3>

        <p>When you go to aa.com on your computer, you are most likely to be A) at home or work and B) looking to book flights or check flight status. American Airlines addresses this by making those actions front and center on the desktop view of the site. </p>

        <p>When users access aa.com on their phone, the conditions change because users are more likely to be on their phones while they are at the airport. This means they are probably trying to check in, check flight status, or even track their bags. Americanairlines.com accounts for these changes by prioritizing and even completely changing the actions available on mobile views. Tracking your bags is a feature you can’t easily access from the desktop view, which makes sense because, most likely, you are already at home with your bags. </p>

        <h3> It’s all done through the power of great minds, and code. </h3>

        <p>Many sites focus on responsive design, which is a great start. You can take your website further if you think about changes in user needs and circumstances from one device to another. Adaptive sites have an auto-detection script within their code that identifies the device being used. Once detected, these adaptive sites show unique code for each device. </p>
