        <p> People are constantly trying to define the word "design". One of the ways people try to, is, first, defining the <span> design process.</span> There are an infinite number of problems which designers are trying to solve, so everyone’s design process is different. Nevertheless, I believe there are a few basic steps in the design process: defining the problem, information gathering, execution, and re-evaluation. </p>

        <h3>  1. Define the Problem </h3>

        <p>Design is awesome for solving problems. This can be as simple as, “I want a new identity for my company i.e. logo, advertisements, etc”, or as complex as, “How can we encourage people to make more sustainable transportation choices?" (One of my real projects: check out <a href="arewethereyet.html">Are We There Yet</a>). Designers need a jumping off point and this can be achieved by simply asking a question.</p>

    
        <h3> 2. The Deets</h3>

        <p>What are the criteria upon which I have to build a solution? Knowing your limitations, and knowing how to break them is a completely separate post. Simply, it’s important for designers to gather as much information about the current state of the problem, because, knowledge is power. This means knowing your client, audience, and any other relevant information is important to feeding the magical powers of design.</p>

        <h4> Nothing is Completely Original </h4>
        <p>You may call me a pessimist, but I stand by this phrase. Luckily, we can learn from our history and not make the same mistakes that designers have made in the past. From confusing advertising campaigns to <a href="http://adage.com/article/behind-the-work/gap-wrong/146393/" target="blank">poor brand mistakes</a>, it's important to pick up on visual motifs that have worked in the past and develop them into something that works for our specific design problem. </p>

  

         <h3>3. Do It! </h3>

        <p>Just, do it.
        </p>   

        <h3> 4. Recap and Readjust </h3>
        <p>
          Following through with a solution means evaluating, and re-evaluating, the finished product. Zooming out and looking at the solution, and its effects, can help guide a designer to be better in the future. Our design process should change each time we complete a new project. Certain aspects of our process may be proven useful or we might be able to systematize our process to become more seamless for the future.
        </p>   
        
        <h3> Closing Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
         Some people jump straight into making, but in reality the steps leading up to and following execution are really what make a design successful. Although you may learn follow a great design process, know that the key to making truly great work is breaking your process. Your process is always more flexible than you realize. You may be having designers block. Don't we all? Get out of Photoshop and try Sketch. By following the same exact process, you will loose your creative powers and go from design wizard to pixel pusher. Break your process and you might be surprised with what you get.
